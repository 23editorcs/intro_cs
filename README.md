# Python Programming - An Introduction to Computer Science
THE WORKBOOK OF PYTHON PROGRAMMING - AN INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER SCIENCE

Hello everyone, 

I am Paul Massimo (not the real one) and 26 year olds. I have an engineering bachelor degree but I don't love the job in factory and want to find out something that I could do it everyday with love. I jumped around a lot of works, then have recently ended up with Computer Science. I love the way people works with computer, how developers could do great things with their software. I want to be them.

In this project, I am going to code all the exercises from the book. I strongly believe that there is nobody is going to read all of these. So, this is just for my motivation and keep me doing it everyday.
